(2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10006) and [Yang et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09582). But this is not the case for open-ended generation where the desired output length can vary greatly, e.g. dialog and story generation.\n",

This is especially hard to control with *n-gram*- or other penalties in story generation since finding a good trade-off between forced \"no-repetition\" and repeating cycles of identical *n-grams* requires a lot of finetuning.\n",

In other words, as humans, we want generated text to surprise us and not to be boring/predictable.

    "\n",
    "[Fan et. al (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04833.pdf) introduced a simple, but very powerful sampling scheme, called ***Top-K*** sampling. In *Top-K* sampling, the *K* most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those *K* next words. \n",
    "GPT2 adopted this sampling scheme, which was one of the reasons for its success in story generation. \n",

    "We extend the range of words used for both sampling steps in the example above from 3 words to 10 words to better illustrate *Top-K* sampling.\n",

While the 6 most likely words, defined as $V_{\\text{top-K}}$ encompass only *ca.* two-thirds of the whole probability mass in the first step, it includes almost all of the probability mass in the second step.

    "# Perplexity\n",
    "Perplexity is a metric commonly used to evaluate the performance of language models in natural language processing (NLP). It measures how well a language model predicts a sample and is a function of the probability that the model assigns to a sequence of words. In essence, perplexity quantifies the uncertainty of a language model in predicting (or \"guessing\") the next token in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The perplexity (P) of a language model for a given sequence of words $W = w_1, w_2, ..., w_N$ is defined as the exponential of the entropy (or cross-entropy if comparing against a true distribution) of the sequence, given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(W) = 2^{H(W)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H(W)$ is the entropy of the sequence $W$, calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H(W) = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log_2 p(w_i | w_{i-1}, ..., w_1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $p(w_i | w_{i-1}, ..., w_1)$ represents the conditional probability of word $w_i$ given all the preceding words $w_1, ..., w_{i-1}$, as predicted by the language model, and $N$ is the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- **Lower Perplexity:** Indicates a better-performing model, as it means the model has less uncertainty in predicting the next word in a sequence. A lower perplexity score suggests that the language model is more confident and accurate in its predictions.\n",
    "- **Higher Perplexity:** Suggests a model with greater uncertainty and less ability to predict the next word accurately. High perplexity indicates that the model's predictions are more spread out over a larger set of possible words.\n"
